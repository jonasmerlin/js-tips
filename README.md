# js-tips
A collection of small but useful tips for JavaScript development.

Once every now and then I stumble upon some small tips for how to improve your quality of life (keep your sanity) while devloping with JavaScript. Things that would almost certainly not be covered in a run of the mill introduction to the language.

These tips come from many different places and I will document their sources whereever I can (remember them.)

'''console.log({ variableToLog })'''
